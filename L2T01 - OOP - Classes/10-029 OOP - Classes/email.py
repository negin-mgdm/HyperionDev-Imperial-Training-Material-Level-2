# --- Email Class --- #
# Create the class, constructor and methods to create a new Email object.

    # Declare the class variable, with default value, for emails. 
 
    # Initialise the instance variables for emails.

    # Create the method to change 'has_been_read' emails from False to True.

# --- Lists --- #
# Initialise an empty list to store the email objects.

# --- Functions --- #
# Build out the required functions for your program.

def populate_inbox():
    
    # Create 3 sample emails and add it to the Inbox list. 

def list_emails():
    
    # Create a function which prints the emailâ€™s subject_line, along with a corresponding number.

def read_email(index):

    # Create a function which displays a selected email. 
    # Once displayed, call the class method to set its 'has_been_read' variable to True.

# --- Email Program --- #

# Call the function to populate the Inbox for further use in your program.

# Fill in the logic for the various menu operations.
