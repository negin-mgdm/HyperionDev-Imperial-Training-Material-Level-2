2. What is a DBMS and what are its advantages?

Databases rely on specialized software referred to as a Database Management System (DBMS). 
The DBMS serves as an intermediary between users and the database, tasked with the organization and control of data access.
The DBMS functions by receiving user requests and subsequently translating them into the intricate operations needed to execute those requests.

One of the significant advantages of using a DBMS is that it shields the user from the complex inner workings of the database. 
The DBMS manages how data is stored, structured, or retrieved.

The DBMS offers a couple of key benefits: Firstly, it enables multiple users and applications to access the same data simultaneously. 
It also ensures that all users see the data in a consistent manner, even if they have different needs. 
So, it acts like a bridge between the diverse data demands and the actual data storage.

The DBMS advantages:
1. Better data integration 2. Improved data access 3. Better data sharing 4. Minimised data inconsistency
5. Improved decision making 6. Increased end-user productivity

4. What is metadata?

Metadata refers to data that provides information about other data. It provides context and information about other data, 
enabling users to understand, categorise, and manage various types of information more effectively. 
This is particularly valuable when dealing with large volumes of data, such as in databases or digital libraries.
